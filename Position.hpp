 * A class storing a Connect 4 position.
 * Functions are relative to the current player to play.
 * Position containing alignment are not supported by this class.
 *
 * A binary bitboard representationis used.
 * Each column is encoded on HEIGH+1 bits.

 *
 * Position is stored as
 * - a bitboard "mask" with 1 on any color stones
 * - a bitboard "current_player" with 1 on stones of current player
 *
 * "current_player" bitboard can be transformed into a compact and non ambiguous key
 * by adding an extra bit on top of the last non empty cell of each column.
 * This allow to identify all the empty cells whithout needing "mask" bitboard
